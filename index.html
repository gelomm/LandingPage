                        and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described
                        as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. He was kidnapped by the Ten Rings 
                       in Afghanistan. With his life on the line, Stark 
                       created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized 
                       several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane. 
                       Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.</div>

Born with the latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark and rallied anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments with the Scepter under the supervision of Baron Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening and amplifying Wanda's powers.</div>

                        dangerous levels of gamma radiation. As a result, the mild-mannered 
                        scientist found that when angered, provoked, or excited, his body and brain would transform into a 
                        huge, rage-fueled, primitive-minded creature known as Hulk.</div>

                    I used to be embarassed because I was just a comic book writer

                    nost important things in people's lives. Without it, they might 
                    go off the deep end.
